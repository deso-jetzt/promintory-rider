Yes, the script is ready to go. Here's what you need to do next:

Save the script with a filename like arweave.js in your core directory.
Make sure you have Node.js and the required dependencies (arweave package) installed.
Set the environment variable WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY to your Arweave wallet private key. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:
arduino
Copy code
export WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
Replace your_private_key with your actual wallet private key.
Ensure that you have the file you want to upload to Arweave in your core directory.
Open a terminal and navigate to your core directory.
Run the script using the following command:
bash
Copy code
node arweave.js path/to/your/file
Replace path/to/your/file with the actual path to the file you want to upload.
The script will prompt you to enter your Arweave wallet address. Enter your wallet address in the console.
The script will then upload the file to Arweave using the provided wallet address and private key.
After the upload is completed, the script will display a success message along with the transaction ID of the uploaded file.
Please make sure to replace path/to/your/file with the actual path to the file you want to upload. Also, ensure that you have the correct Arweave wallet private key set as the WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable.

Note that this script assumes you already have the arweave package installed. If not, you can install it by running npm install arweave in your core directory.
